> **Editor’s Note:** The following column includes language from the Article 12 Impact Guide. The full guide is available on the [Maintenance Division page](https://apwu.org).  

The **Electronic Workhour Estimator Program (eWHEP)** is the USPS program used to estimate Maintenance Craft work hours and authorize positions in functional Maintenance Craft areas. The current instruction is **MMO-102-18**. This column focuses on the Mail Processing Equipment section of eWHEP, which includes:  
- Inventory and annual staffing hours for LDC 36 employees (ETs, MPEs, MMs)  
- Staffing hours primarily based on combined Maintenance Management Orders (MMOs) for individual machines/equipment  

Follow these steps to challenge your eWHEP staffing package:

### Step 1: Obtain a Copy of the eWHEP  
If not already secured, submit a **written request** for:  
> *“In pdf format, a copy of the current/complete/authorized eWHEP staffing package for [installation or facility name], to include all forms and worksheets.”*  

- Specify delivery method (email/thumb drive)  
- Retain proof of submission and receipt of your Request for Information (RFI)

### Step 2: Verify eWHEP Mail Processing Equipment Inventory  
Review these mechanized staffing documents:  

#### Section 2A: *Miscellaneous Postal Equipment*  
- Smaller/portable equipment (e.g., strapping machines, portable conveyers)  
- Maintenance hours determined by current MMOs for each item  

#### Section 2B: *Major Mechanization/Automation*  
- Highly visible equipment (e.g., DIOSS, APBS machines)  
- **Action:** Confirm inventory counts match physical equipment (e.g., 6 DIOSS machines must show 6 entries)  

#### Worksheet 2C: *Additional Requirements*  
- New equipment without MMOs  
- Locally purchased mail processing items  
- Items with updated MMOs not yet reflected in eWHEP

### Step 3: Analyze eMARS Staffing Worksheets for Operational Tours  
Review **eMARS Staffing Worksheets** for:  
1. Days per week machines operate  
2. Tours per day machines run  
3. Stackers per machine  

#### Key Issue: Tour Misrepresentation  
- Historically: Management manually entered tour counts  
- Currently: Software auto-populates tours, **often underreporting** (e.g., machines running 3 tours shown as 1–2)  
- *This discrepancy is scheduled for National Arbitration in 2021*  

#### Evidence Collection  
Gather to prove underreported tours:  
- Employee statements  
- Management interviews  
- Machine runtime reports  
- Clerk/Mail Handler weekly schedules  
> **Critical:** Maintain regular documentation. Challenges require substantial concrete evidence.
